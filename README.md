# Common Tools
Common tools for cp3-llbb analyses, these are here to help getting things done! Dedicated instructions should lie within each subdirectory.

Available tools for now are:
  * plotUtils: to create histograms out of the framework ntuples

## First time setup instructions

```bash
# download the repository, do that preferably outside of CMSSW (there is no need to send your plots in every crab job...)
git clone -o upstream git@github.com:cp3-llbb/CommonTools.git CommonTools

# setup git and its remote
source setup.sh
```
